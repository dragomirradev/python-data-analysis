# python-data-analysis
A hands-on tutorial on data analysis using Python programming language using Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials are pretty much a **work in progress** and may contain deprecated code, errors and
typos or even out right mis-information. It will be great to keep this information in perspective
while using this.

If you find anything inaccurate, pull requests are most welcome.
