			This page links to multiple python notebooks containing code samples
			along with small explanations in English for conducting analysis of various kinds of data - textual,
            relational, time series, audio and visual data.
            Most of the code is dependent on Pandas, Numpy and Scipy. Some ML bits use scikits-learn and Tensorflow.

		<p>
			The content does not deep dive into the theory behind most of the
			techniques described and assumes working knowledge of Python programming
			language.
